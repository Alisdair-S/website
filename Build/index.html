<h2>How we transformed our pen and paper design idea into a real nanodevice</h2>

<h2>'Laying the ground': preparing fluorophore-filled liposomes</h2>
<p>We used large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) as vehicles for drug delivery.
  To model the kinetics of the potential drug and assess the effectiveness
  of our nanodevice we loaded them with a fluorophore (calcein). For practice
  purposes, at first we assembled empty, and later calcein-filled vesicles with
  nothing embedded in their membranes, using a mixture of DOPC and DOPE.
  Extrusion ensured that the resulting vesicles were all unilamellar and of
  the same size (200 nm). Then we assessed their quality via Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS).

<h2>Assembling DNA Nanopores</h2>
<p>We constructed the DNA nanopores for our device by following the design
developed by Howorka (2017). Each nanopore comprised six hexagonally arranged
duplexes and a lock strand, the conformation of which determined the state of the
pore (open or closed). Cholesterol anchors attached to some duplexes allowed
embedding charged DNA molecules into the lipid membranes. The sequences for each
DNA strand were imported from Howorka (2017) and ordered from IDT.<p>
  <p>DNA nanopores were assembled in two states: open (NP-O) and closed (NP-C). Applying
  a detergent and a +40 mV voltage facilitated their insertion into membranes.</p>
  <p>If NP-O's were embedded into membranes, calcein leaked out of the vesicles. To make sure
NP-C's have inserted successfully, restriction nucleases were applied to the solution to
hydrolyse DNA nanopores, and the fluorophore movement was then observed. We also
made sure the fluorophore did not leak out through closed nanopores.</p>
<p>After perfecting our techniques of handling static DNA nanopores we moved on to testing
  them in their dynamic state by applying the key strands. ........</p>
