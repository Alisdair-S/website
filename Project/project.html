<h1>About the project</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Since its discovery in 1953, DNA, the molecule that nature evolved to perpetuate and express genetic information, has revolutionised medicine, pharmaceutical industry, agriculture and led to the development of biotechnology.
    All of these applications are predicated on the complementarity of the two strands of DNA, rooted in the hydrogen bonded base pairing between adenine (A) and thymine (T) and between guanine (G) and cytosine (C).
    By exploiting these base-pairing rules, self-assembled structures can be built simply by programming sequences of DNA. This process, combined with the current ability to synthesize almost any sequence in an automated fashion, enables the construction of novel structures and devices unfound in nature.
    As the DNA double helix is inherently a nanoscale object (diameter is about 2 nm), nanoscientists are interested in exploiting these nanoscale properties and  programmatically assemble complex materials with nanoscale features. This pursuit is termed DNA nanotechnology, an area that began in the early 1980s and since then had made significant progresses (Seeman, 2007).
    A diverse range of nanostructures have already been devised and the construction principles continue to push the boundaries of what can be designed and built (Feldkamp and Niemeyer, 2008). One of the most intriguing recent advances is DNA origami (Rothemund, 2006), structures of single strand of DNA  folded into a shape using shorter 'stapling' strands. The result is an approach that can easily create large, complex and eye-catching nanostructures.
    Synthetic biology has considerable interest to rationally engineer the complex functions of membrane proteins for biotechnological applications. However, this is limited by the notorious difficulty of producing and handling membrane proteins as well as their intricate physicochemical properties.
    A potential alternative is offered by DNA nanotechnology, which allows to rationally design  DNA nanostructures that mimic biological protein nanopores. Indeed, DNA-based transmembrane nanopores have recently mimicked integral channel proteins (Hager et al., 2018).
    Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy demonstrated  that DNA nanopores carrying cholesterol anchors insert via a two-step mechanism into membranes (Birkholz, 2018).

<h2>Aims</h2>
<p>This project aims to exploit advances in DNA nanotechnology to develop an intelligent drug delivery system. This comprises liposomes (vesicles of phospholipid bilayers) that encapsulate drug molecules. Such drug-capsules are engineered to be “intelligent” by inserting DNA molecules that can sense environmental conditions, perform computational logic and release drugs on demand.
