<h1>About the project</h1>

<div style="background-color:lightblue">
<h2>Introduction kev</h2>
<p>Since its discovery in 1953, DNA, the molecule that nature evolved to perpetuate and express genetic information, has revolutionised medicine, pharmaceutical industry, agriculture and led to the development of biotechnology.
    All of these applications are predicated on the complementarity of the two strands of DNA, rooted in the hydrogen bonded base pairing between adenine (A) and thymine (T) and between guanine (G) and cytosine (C).
    By exploiting these base-pairing rules, self-assembled structures can be built simply by programming sequences of DNA. This process, combined with the current ability to synthesize almost any sequence in an automated fashion, enables the construction of novel structures and devices unfound in nature.
    As the DNA double helix is inherently a nanoscale object (diameter is about 2 nm), nanoscientists are interested in exploiting these nanoscale properties and  programmatically assemble complex materials with nanoscale features. This pursuit is termed DNA nanotechnology, an area that began in the early 1980s and since then had made significant progresses (Seeman, 2007).
    A diverse range of nanostructures have already been devised and the construction principles continue to push the boundaries of what can be designed and built (Feldkamp and Niemeyer, 2008). One of the most intriguing recent advances is DNA origami (Rothemund, 2006), structures of single strand of DNA  folded into a shape using shorter 'stapling' strands. The result is an approach that can easily create large, complex and eye-catching nanostructures.
    Synthetic biology has considerable interest to rationally engineer the complex functions of membrane proteins for biotechnological applications. However, this is limited by the notorious difficulty of producing and handling membrane proteins as well as their intricate physicochemical properties.
    A potential alternative is offered by DNA nanotechnology, which allows to rationally design  DNA nanostructures that mimic biological protein nanopores. Indeed, DNA-based transmembrane nanopores have recently mimicked integral channel proteins (Hager et al., 2018).
    Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy demonstrated  that DNA nanopores carrying cholesterol anchors insert via a two-step mechanism into membranes (Birkholz, 2018).

<h2>Aims</h2>
<p>This project aims to exploit advances in DNA nanotechnology to develop an intelligent drug delivery system. This comprises empty synthetic cells (liposomes) that encapsulate drug molecules. Such drug-capsules are engineered to be “intelligent” by inserting DNA molecules that can sense environmental conditions, perform computation and release drugs on demand. The motivation behind this is to develop biocompatible smart drug vesicles that can deliver drugs only to specific organs, release them only when certain pathogens/molecules are detected (essentially act as synthetic leukocytes), and/or to.
In order to achieve this, we are designing DNA nanostructures as bio-inspired nanopores. Functionalizing the oligonucleotides with hydrophobic molecules can then permit the incorporation of such structures into lipid bilayers. The shape and diameter of the nanopores can be engineered to dictate a cut-off for the diffusion of macromolecules. These DNA nanopores will constitute the DNA gates embedded in the membranes of the drug-encapsulating vesicles.
In addition, such nanopores might offer improvements over the current state of the art for nanopore-based DNA sequencing.

<h2>Impact</h2>

Liposomes equipped with DNA nanopores can be used for active targeting of therapeutic drugs by programming DNA nanopores to open in response to the presence of a specific disease biomarker.
Our project focuses on proteases associated with metastatic cancers.
However, DNA nanopores can potentially be tailored to a wide range of ligands.
Further development of this technology will thus allow delivering drugs in a specific, efficient and strictly control manner, thus preventing overdoses.

<h2>Previous work </h2>

DNA-based transmembrane nanopores have recently mimicked integral channel proteins (Hager et al., 2018)
Burns et al. (2016), has shown that such DNA nanopores can bind to specific ligands (ssDNA) and, in response, undergo a nanomechanical change to open up the membrane-spanning channel.
Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that DNA nanopores carrying cholesterol anchors insert via a two-step mechanism into membranes (Birkholz, 2018).
The aim of this project is to release active compounds close to cancerous cells that are prone to metastasise. Previous studies have shown that the mitochondrial processing peptidase MPP7 exists in higher concentrations in proximity of metastasising cancers (etal). ssDNA “Key” sequences that open the DNA-nanopore are linked to the liposome via a peptide sequence that contains the recognition sequence for a peptidase. Thus these sequences are released and available to open the DNA-nanopore when these peptidases are present. By encapsulating active compounds within the liposomes, these substances are released conditionally when these proteases are present.
