    <h3>Monday, July 1</h3>
    <p>Official first day. However, not everyone is in London. We are still sorting out money stuff.</p>

    <h3>Tuesday, July 2</h3>
    <p>Eduard and Alberto arrived in London.
    Miro sent out lots of sponsorship emails.
    Georg and Alberto chased Baldwin for CDT studentships.</p>

    <h3>Wednesday, July 3</h3>
    <p>Alisdair, Sonia, Eduard, Alberto, Kevin and Georg meet at 10 am on campus. In the morning we worked on sending out sponsorship emails. We also sent out -mails to the Head of Department (and president of the Biochemical Society) Anne Dell for travel grants. Kevin is trying to contact the BBSRC (since it sponsored the Oxford team in 2017).
    Ismael arrives to say hi at 12. Lunch in JCR.
    In the afternoon we set out more sponsorship requests. We also went to the enterprise lab to ask for more money. We also set up a crowdfunding page on kickstarter. Our design student Eduard has started working on the logo.</p>

    <h3>Thursday, July 4</h3>
    <p>Slightly positive news from the Enterprise Lab for funding. We discussed what to discuss for tomorrow’s meeting with Oscar Ces. We planned steps in wet lab and dry lab.
    Manos dropped out.
    First name idea: Nano DIPs (DNA Imperial/Intelligent Pores).
    The final year biochemists got their transcripts today.
    Alisdair downloaded Cadnano.
    Eddie is working on the logo.
    The raspberry pie arrives. </p>

    <h3>Friday, July 5</h3>
    <p>Meeting with Oscar, 9am (white city).
    Apologies from Miro: I would like to Skype in.
    Present: Sonia, Ismael, Alisdair, Georg, Alberto, Eduard, Kevin, Oscar Ces, David Miller
    We discussed logistics in the labs and feasibility of experiments.
    He suggested us to use Kanban boards to be efficient. It is essentially a highly organised japanese post-it system.
    We outlined some funding strategies (e.g. more targeted emails to just 10-15 companies and copying him in).
    At 10 we met with David. He suggested to make a list of things we need to start running experiments. The wet lab is going to replicate the Burns, Reifer and Howorka (2016) paper as a first sanity check. In the meantime, the dry lab (Alisdair) familiarises with Cadnano.
    Lunch in a street food market in White City.
    With IDT you can order DNA sequences with cholesterol at the 3’-ends, so they can attach to membranes.
    At 5 everyone goes home.</p>

      <h3>Monday, July 8</h3>
      <p>Sonia, Eduard, Kevin and Alberto meet at the hackspace in the morning. Georg, Alisdair and Miro are working remotely.
      No great news regarding sponsorhips. We tried to chase Baldwin but he was elusive.
      Sonia and Alberto made a protocol for making liposomes filled with fluorophores.
      We need an extruder to make multilamellar liposomes into unilamellar (just one bilayer).
      Our first logo is now online (https://nanodips.github.io/home/).  </p>

      <h3>Tuesday, July 9</h3>
      <p>There is the chemical biology symposium in White City today. Apperently Stefan Howorka is talking there about DNA nanopores. We managed to sneak in at the conference asd listen to the lecture. Some thoughts about DNA Nanopores: "What is the benefit of transporting single DNA molecules through tiny holes ? DNA sequencing. Biosensing.Detecting analytes is possible using ON/OFF switch approach (not reversible). This can be adapted. to create a protein sensitive pore. The presence of a protein lead to specific signal. These DNA pores are completely new. What are the properties ? Not as stable as the protein pores… more wavy and flexible. This is something that needs to be addressed" (Howorka, 2019). Meeting with David at ICAH at 5</p>

      <h3>Wednesday, July 10</h3>
      <p>
      Meeting in White city in the morning. Present: Albi, Georg, Sonia, Kevin, Edward.  Miro is working from Home. Positive news from the Bioeng department.Massive brainstorming day. We came up with the key-Tree idea. DNA keys are displayed to the surface of the liposome via a peptide linker. The peptide contains a recognition sequence for the MMP7 protease, which is secreted by metastasising cancer cells. Thus metastatic cells can trigger the opening of the pore and the release of a chemotherapy drug. We talked with Ryan about the issue with access to hackspace. The website is under construction. The protocols have been reviewed and approved.
      </p>

      <h3>Thursday, July 11</h3>
      <p>
      Good news from the sponsorship front. The CDT in BioDesign Engineering announced that it will fund up to 8 6-week summer bursaries for undergraduate students (also final year students). Now we need to generate momentum and follow up with the Head of Department of Bioengineering. Also the Enterprise Lab is giving us 2ks. We can start buying flights already perhaps. In the afternoon, meeting at the Hackspace for the daily meeting with David. Prepare for meeting with Oscar tomorrow.
      </p>

      <h3>Friday, July 12</h3>
      <p> At 9, meeting with Oscar and David at the Hackspace.
      Things discussed: Novel idea: DNA key-tree. Cancer-specific proteases release keys. Maybe use trypsin instead of the hard-to get MMP7. Update about BioDesign CDT bursaries. He suggested to design every experiment as a controllable separate step. We need a lot of DNA (IDT !!!). Probably we can get more funding from the Hackspace. We need to be careful when using the extruder to wach out fluorescent stuff. Introduced Kevin to the world of Github Desktop. Eddie spilled water on himself and he is working on the vortex animation. Alisdair is working on cadnano. The IDT quote has been sent to David, hopefully DNA arrives soon.

      <h2>Monday, July 15</h2>
      <p> Sonia, Kevin, Albi, Georg and Alisdair met at the Hackspace in the afternoon. Miro is working from Slovakia. Eddi is coming back to London from Austria on wednesday. 
        Wrote other follow up e-mails.
        Update with key trees.
        Daily meeting with David at 5.  </p>

      <h2>Tuesday, July 16</h2>
      <p>Everyone worked remotely.
        We sent the IDT quote to David.
        Laid down the basic architecture for the website.
        We are constructing it from scratch (no template, no nothing) in Atom now.
        We are still waiting for the extruder to arrive. As a result, the wet lab is inactive at the moment.
        Hopefully next week we can start making liposomes.
       </p>

      <h2>Wednesday</h2>
      <p>We ordered flights from London Heathrow to San Francisco. We are leaving on wednesday 23rd of October. Thank you Enterprise Lab !
      The Jamboree is on the weekends. Then we will fly back on Tuesday.
      Apart from Georg and Eddi, who are oing to saty in the USA until November.
      The IDT order has been received, so hopefully in a wekk we can start assembling some DNA pores. </p>
